# Given a closed electrical circuit, we need to identify the redundant elements.
# For the sake of simplicity, we shall assume only resistors between vairous 
# points. Electricity will flow through the path of least resistance!
# Source of electricity is A and end-point is G.
#
# The idea of the program is to find the redundant resistors
# 
# As shown in the diagram we can 'translate' load between points
# into any simple data structures. For example:
# [
#  [ A, B, 50],
#  [ A, D, 150],
#  [ B, C, 250],
#  [ B, E, 250],
#  [ C, E, 350],
#  [ C, D, 300],
#  [ C, F, 100],
#  [ D, F, 400],
#  [ E, G, 200],
#  [ F, G, 100],
# ]
#
# Feel free to use any other data structures as long as assumptions are simple
# and understandable. Start and End points may be hard-coded in the script or 
# can be taken as command line parameters, whichever you feel is convinient.
#
# In the above example, redundant resitoirs are: R1, R5, R6, R7, R10, R4
